Traffic Regulation Authorities (TRAs) and Digital Solution Providers (DSPs) can register for the service as data publishers.

This involves a two-step onboarding process. Firstly, create an account in the integration environment to access a sandbox environment, separate from the live service, to test publishing D-TRO data in a safe, non-production setting. After successfully publishing test D-TROs in the sandbox environment, you can set up a production account to publish live data to the D-TRO service.
