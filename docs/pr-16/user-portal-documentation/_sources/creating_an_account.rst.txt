Creating an Account
===================

When accessing the portal, you will be required to log in. If you already have an account see :ref:`login` for details on how to log in. If you do not have an account, click the link on the login page to begin the account creation process.

Firstly, you must choose whether you are creating a publisher account or a consumer account. A publisher account allows you to publish D-TROs to the service. Publishers require express permission from Department for Transport, and requests for publisher accounts will be reviewed by a Central Service Operator. Consumer accounts are required to consume data from the D-TRO service. The D-TRO data is freely-accessible by design, and there are no restrictions around consumer accounts.

.. note::
    Publisher accounts have the ability to create publisher applications **and** consumer applications; it is not required to create two different account types.
