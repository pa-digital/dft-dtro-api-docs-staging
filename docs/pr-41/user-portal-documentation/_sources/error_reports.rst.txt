=============

    :heading: Note

    This functionality is only available in the production environment.

The portal includes the abilty to submit reports if you think you may have identified issues with the D-TRO data. Submitted D-TRO data is validated against a known schema to ensure it is valid, but content is not checked. If you think you have identified issues with D-TRO data content, you can use this service to submit your findings. A Central Service Operator will review your submission, and action appropriately.

.. note::
    This service is solely for submitting issues in D-TRO data quality. General feedback or questions about the D-TRO service should be directed towards the D-TRO or Central Service Operator mailboxes.

An error report can either relate to a specific TRO, or can be a more general report that affects many TROs spanning potentially several Traffic Regulation Authorities. Select the correct type of error report you wish to submit.

TRO-specific error report
*************************

A TRO-specific error report requires entering a valid D-TRO ID. The ID is validated against the list of submitted D-TROs to ensure it does exist. You must also choose the type of error, and provide a description of the issue. Optionally you may upload one or more image files as supporting evidence.
