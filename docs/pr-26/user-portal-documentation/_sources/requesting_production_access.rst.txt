    This functionality is only available in the integration environment.

In the integration environment portal, clicking 'Request production access' from the navigation screen will submit a request to create an account, and subsequently applications, in the production environment. You will be navigated to a confirmation screen to confirm your request has been successful. Your request will be sent to a Central Service Operator for review.
